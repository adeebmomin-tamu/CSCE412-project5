            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                Howdy! My name is Adeeb Momin and I am a junior at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/index.html" target="_blank">Texas A&M University</a>. 
                I am majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Psychology. I've always been 
                fascinated with how new technology is studying human behavior to learn. Studying 
                both has given me a cool way to combine these two interests.
                Right now, I am conducting machine learning research, where I am working with Google 
                Gemini API and fine tuning this Large Language Model to create a chatbot for industry control. 
                It's great to see how AI and machine learning are growing and being utilzied in real world scenariois. <br> <br>
                When i'm not working, I like to play sports like <a href="https://usapickleball.org/what-is-pickleball/" target="_blank">pickleball</a> 
                (new hobby) and volleyball. I also really enjoy reading 
                (I am currently reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/128029.A_Thousand_Splendid_Suns" target="_blank">A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini)</a>. 
                Playing video games has been a childhood hobby
                that has stuck with me, and my current favorite game has to be <a href="https://tracker.gg/valorant/profile/riot/Lightskin%23b58/overview" target="_blank">Valorant</a>. 
                Some other hobbies I have are traveling, hiking,
                cooking, and obviously CODING! If you wish to learn more, please click on the links above or connect with me on <a href="www.linkedin.com/in/adeeb-momin">LinkedIn</a> or
